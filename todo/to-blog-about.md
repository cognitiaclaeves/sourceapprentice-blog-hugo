* To Blog About (in StackEdit)  
  TODO: (before initial deployment)

* revisit bootstrap-solarized in github:
* [https://github.com/cognitiaclaeves/herring-cove-solarized](https://github.com/cognitiaclaeves/herring-cove-solarized "https://github.com/cognitiaclaeves/herring-cove-solarized")
* [https://github.com/cognitiaclaeves/bootstrap-solarized](https://github.com/cognitiaclaeves/bootstrap-solarized "https://github.com/cognitiaclaeves/bootstrap-solarized")
* Will eventually want to merge bootstrap and solarized theme
* use multiple config to pass domain name for cookie interaction
