When I thought about what I wanted in a serverless blogging solution, I knew that adding images to my blog entries was likely going to be a thing. I had anticipating needing to write my website that I'd use to manage images. That day might still come. But not today.

This morning I found [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io), which is effectively a CMS that can be used for static web site generators. I write it about it [here](unimplemented "unimplemented"). I started using it for maintaining the content of my site immediately.

While I was working my through the setup process, I noticed that it has some kind of setup for using AWS S3 for media. If things go really well, this means that I won't have a pressing need to write my own site to do this.
