I've had a few questions come up in interviews that basically asked me to give my take (summary) of devops. Over time, what's really stuck with me were two things: devops is a practice based on a certain \[company-backed\] culture, and infrastructure-as-code is vital. ... But something about this answer  started to feel empty to me, the more I gave it.

In one of my recent interviews, I was told that the team I could be joining had just started diving into Devops principles via the Devops Handbook. I'd read this book -- after it had been thrown at me at a Devops Days Austin conference. When it was mentioned during the interview, I had a thought that I might want to read it again / review it. However, as far as book writing goes, the book is kind of awful -- I wasn't looking forward to slogging through it again. What it lacks in writing it makes up in the sheer "oh my god, I've been there" factor. I think that's why it's so popular.

Fortunately, [someone has already written a handy review](http://agilejazz.blogspot.com/p/the-devops-handbook-summary-1-of-4.html "Devops Handbook Summary, Part 1").
