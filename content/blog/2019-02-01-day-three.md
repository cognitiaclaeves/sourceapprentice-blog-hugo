I opened my laptop begrudgingly this evening after work. My brain feels tired, almost like there's nothing left to solve problems with. This fatigue is why I want to get my blogging system down to the easiest possible work-flow.

But enough about that.

I see that my next micro-task was getting pelican generating a single page.

Quick distraction: Future note to self - I'd like to incorporate a [TDD approach](https://github.com/mjhea0/flaskr-tdd) into my project soon.

After a short period of experimentation, I was unable to figure out how to generate HTML for the content I had added.

It wasn't until the next day that I realized that I was missing a dependency -- markdown. I think I was confused because Jinja installs markupSafe. Additionally, I found that there needed to be no empty lines before the metadata at the top.
