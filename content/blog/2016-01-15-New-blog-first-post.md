About a year ago, I tried to start another blog. I have had this nasty habit of trying to start blogs, and then just not keeping up with them. This time was going to be different. Until I started it with Wordpress. I honestly don't know why anyone has time for that platform. On my first entry, I ran into the issue of Wordpress ignoring my desired line-spacing, and willfully inserting its own. What? I can't control the output? I have to just settle for whatever Wordpress thinks is sufficient? That's not my usual relationship with software. I prefer to do the deciding, and for the software to comply. Consistently.

The next gotcha that I ran into was when one of my posts just mysteriously disappeared while writing it. I looked into using plugins to back it up, and then determined that the words that I anticipated spending my time writing ... were hidden away in a database somewhere. Worse, it looked like it was going to be a thing to restore a site.

I don't have time for such things. I live in a word where I allocate most of my time trying to figure out how to get computers to do things. For a while, that was all that I had time to do. Because depression. ... It was a balancing act: how to do the work that I need to do to complete my work goals with the time that I'm not under a cloud of darkness?

Today, depression hits me differently. Mostly, I remain standing. The darkness is not nearly as dense. The last few times, I found myself saying that I felt like I could not track my thoughts, but it hadn't registered as depression to me because there wasn't a feeling of hopelessness. For now, I'm guessing that this is what depression feels like when the biological process happens and doesn't trigger a mood drop. I'm guessing this because I'm taking preventative measures against mood drops, like exercising, and observing and curating my thoughts.

My process has led me to intentionally structure my time for more space away from work. I use this time to come closer to achieving that work-life balance that the company was always talking about.

So today, I have time for myself. I consider it mandatory to invest some of that time into exercise. I also choose to spend time with loved ones. And quality of life management.

Quality of life management is a new category for me. So much so, that I'm not really sure what I should call it. For the past two years, I have lived in a room that seems too small for me. It may actually be too small. But I've never been able to keep things put away long enough to make that determination. Because there isn't much space. And depression. ... When a wave hit, it used to wash out everything under my feet.

Structuring my work to leave more time for myself was a bold move for me. Accepting that I needed more time than I was getting in order to manage my life was not an easy thing for me to do. At first, I tried a career change.

This was, in itself, huge for me. I went from the software / system administration field to becoming an LMT. While working in a brand new field to me, the difference between being in a field where I truly knew very little, and being in a field that was difficult for a human being to do with his brain, became more evident to me. I had been telling myself that I just wasn't any good at what I had been doing. But something about working in a new field with very knowledge helped to better frame the evidence I had that I was actually quite skilled in the field that I had left.

I'm off topic. Here's the short version: I got a new job at the same company doing exactly what I wanted ( instead of what I had been doing ), paying twice as much, with more time off for myself.

With that, I'm back to the present, where I sit typing on 750words.com ( because it seemed interesting to do it that way ), in anticipation of loading this blog post into a new site that doesn't run Wordpress, but instead, takes advantage of the distributed repository, github, and runs Jekyll in a container to generate these words, literally from plain text paragraphs into what you see right now.


- Backup? Check.
- Formatting? Check.
- Efficiency? Check.


In a future post, I'll address more about Jekyll, and how not having prefabricated css influenced my design decisions.
