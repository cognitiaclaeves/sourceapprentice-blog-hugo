Day four of this project is all about figuring out if I'll be able to generate a single page of content. I think this is necessary in order to minimize cost of lambda processing.

I quickly determined that, because of the way that the site is generated, an addition of one blog entry can actually touch many different pages: pages for archives, authors, any related category pages, any related tag pages may all need to be updated. And it can't be possible to correctly update them without having the other content pages contextually available to pelican.

This could have been the thing that ended my project, except I discovered that pelican has a way to generate a subset of pages.
